                           ******************************* AIGEN Tool  *********************************

AIGEN is an open source tool for the generation of transition systems in a symbolic representation "AIGER". To ensure diversity, it employs a uniform random sampling over the space of all Boolean functions with a given number of variables. AIGEN relies on reduced ordered binary decision diagrams (ROBDDs) and canonical disjunctive normal form (CDNF) as canonical representations that allow us to enumerate Boolean functions, in the former case with an encoding that is inspired by data structures used to implement ROBDDs. Several parameters allow the user to restrict generation to Boolean functions or transition systems with certain properties, which are then output in AIGER
format. .


                           ******************************* INSTALLATION  *********************************

This guide assumes that python is installed on the user machine. If it is not the
case, use the following command:

	- sudo apt in-stall python3.8

To install the tool automatically run the following commands: (this will take around 15 minutes due to the abc tool compiling time)
	- chmod +x setup.sh
	- ./setup.sh

                           **************************** Manual Installation ******************************

To install it manually:

1- Unzip AIGEN Tool

2- Open to mpmath-1.1.0 Folder

3- run the command: sudo python3 setup.py install

4- Open aiger-1.9.9 Folder

5- run the command ./configure.sh && make

6- copy the executable "aigtoaig" to parent folder i.e. in the same location of "Convert-Int-To-Bdd_out.py"

7- run the command: sudo apt-get install libtinfo-dev

8- run the command: sudo dpkg -i libreadline-dev_8.0-4_amd64.deb

9- Open abc-master folder

10- run the command: make

11- copy the executable "abc" to parent folder i.e. in the same location of "aigen.py"

12- run the command: sudo apt install python3-pip

13- run the command: sudo apt-get install libgmp-dev

14- run the command: sudo apt-get install libmpfr-dev

15- run the command: sudo apt-get install libmpc-dev

16- run the command: pip3 install gmpy2
                                                      
                           **************************** Test the Tool ************************************
                           
The following is a sample command to run the tool:

python aigen.py -bdd -output FileName.aag -c 1 -u 1 -l 10 -o 9 -noABC

where:

- "FileName.aag" is the file name to be generated
- "-bdd" means that use a bdd based random generation. When replaced by "-dnf" the tool will use canonical DNF based random generation.
- "-c 1" means 1 controllable input
- "-u 1" means 1 uncontrollable inputs
- "-l 10" means 10 latches (i.e. the tool will generate 12 boolean functions over 15 variables)
- "-o 9" means that 9 latches variable influences the output function (i.e. the output function will assign true to (l - o) variables and in this case (10-9) )
- "-noABC" is an optional parameter. A user has to omit it if he wants to run the ABC tool minimization procedure that reduces the size of the generated AIGER file.

To replicate an existing file (an AIGER file that was generated previously by AIGEN tool), use as arguments the same model (bdd or dnf), number of uncontrollable inputs, number of controllable inputs, number of latches, the same number of output variables, and the same seeds. All these info can be found as comments at the end of the file. Note that the number of seeds must be equal to l + 1.

The following is a sample command to regenerate an existing AIGER file tool:

python aigen.py -bdd -output random_n_14_4_3_7_6.aag -c 4 -u 3 -l 7 -o 6 -seeds 1589315720245050 1589315720836518 1589315721306326 1589315721746553 1589315722185292 1589315722596544 1589315722995663 1589315723406943 -oseed 1589315723415047 

"-oseed" is the seed for the random 6 variables chosen out of 7 latches.

Unfortunately, Table 2 cannot be replicated as it was generated by the competition chairs, however these results can be found at the following URL:

                          ****************************** Figures Replication ********************************

Paper Figures Replication


To replicate Figures 2 and 3: (This will take around 20 minutes. Recommended as to replicate Figure 3 the tool will take tens of hours...)
1- Run the command: chmod +x experiment-noABC.sh
2- Run the command: ./experiment-noABC.sh   >>>>> This will generate aiger files in folder "experiments" and "generates plots.pdf" file
											
											             ***************

To replicate Figures 2, 3, and 4: (WARNING: this will take tens of hours...)
1- Run the command: chmod +x experiment.sh 
2- Run the command: ./experiment.sh   >>>>> This will generate aiger files in folder "experiments" and "generates plots.pdf" file
